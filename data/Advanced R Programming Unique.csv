Speaker: Hadley Wickham
Date: 6/20/2019

Abstract

Functional programming (FP) provides a rich set of tools for reducing duplication in your code. The goal of FP is to make it easy to express repeated actions using high-level verbs. I think that learning a little about FP is really important for data scientists, because it's a really good fit for many problems that you'll encounter in practice.

In this talk, I'll introduce you to the basics of functional programming in R, using the purrr package. I'll begin by briefly dissecting the for loop that you're already familiar with, then continue to show why functional programming provides elegant alternatives. I'll next dive into two examples showing where FP is particularly useful in data science: when ingesting unruly datasets spread across multiple files, and producing multiple reports for different stakeholders.

You'll get the most out of this talk if you're familiar with R, or you've done data science in other languages like Python.

This is a two-day hands-on workshop based on the book ""R Markdown: The Definitive Guide"". 

This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level. We'll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.

You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of the amazing breadth and depth of R Markdown. You'll get the most from it if you enjoy learning how R Markdown works under the hood (which will involve reading some source code), and are seriously interested in hacking (playing) with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, LaTeX, and command-line tools. We will give minimal tutorials on these languages and tools in the workshop, but it may be easier for you to keep pace with the instructor if you already know them before.

This workshop is led by Yihui Xie, Software Engineer and Data Scientist at RStudio. Yihui is the main author of the open-source knitr package for reproducible research and dynamic report generation. He has also created and co-authored several other R packages, including rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, xaringan, tinytex, DT, shiny, and leaflet. He has authored and co-authored four books: Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown, blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown, and R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.

It's only an introduction to Advanced Data Analysis, and we will continue every Saturdays with more advanced tasks. The main goal is to develop the interest of mathematical programming among students from Africa. However, anyone who interested is welcome to join and learn. This class will be a good introduction to data analysis with advanced statistical software like R.

Below summarizes the content of this YouTube video- third lesson:

DISCLAIMER: This is a continuation of the previous YouTube videos, so watch them before this video. That will help us wrap up all we have done in our previous meetings so far before we start the Inferential Statistical Analyses (ie. statistical tests and models) from next week. The script (and a Jupyter HTML file) for this video has been uploaded on Piazza platform for you to practice at your own pace with it afterwards.

The primary goal of this third meeting/youtube video is to solve some assignment tasks to wrap up what has been learnt so far. Below are the assignment tasks (from Saturday's class dated October 31, 2020):

1. Assign the names to the levels of the categorical variables (Residence) where 1 means South; 2 means North; 3 means East; 4 means West.

2. Create a new numerical variable called Total_points; which is obtained after adding both the Enrolment_Points and Mathematics points for each student & add this new variable (Total_points) to the original data.

3. Convert their Mathematics points to a categorical variable called Mathematics_grade with categories: i) Low class if Mathematics point is less 40% ii) Medium class if Mathematics point is from 40% to 70%  and iii) High class if Mathematics point greater than 70%.

4. Save the new data as a  CSV file directly into your working directory/DataAnalysis_results_R folder.

5. Create your own function to compute descriptive/summary statistics (just update what I created already in the second meeting dated October 24, 2020). The summary statistics function should:  i) First determine the type of variable, ii). If it's numeric find & return mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, standard error, skewness, kurtosis and 95% quantile recorded to 2 decimal places as well as histogram plot of the numeric variable coloured by ‚Äúgreen‚Äù colour. iii) Else if it is categorical, it should find & return percentages for all categories/levels (in 1 decimal place) and the name of the categories as a data frame as well as plot a pie chart with percentages for each category of the variable with different colours.

6. For each variable, find the summary statistics with the data created above.

7. Depict at least 8 figures/plots (it can be more than 8) using only ggplot2 package to describe the data the best you can as a Data scientist (example of the plots are line graphs, scatter plots, barplot, boxplot, histograms of numeric variables across different categories, barchart of categorical variables distinguishing between different categories variables, etc ). Figures should be nice and very informative too as a professional Data Scientist.

8. Produce 5 different plots to also summarize the data the best you can without the use of the ggplot2 package.


9. Find the correlation matrix plots between all the numerical variables (Enrolment_points, Mathematics points and Total points) using the ""PerformanceAnalytics"" R package.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Dm5IEw0DUk/default.jpg,Clement Twumasi Educative Channel,306,15,0,0,4,"#R,#Statistics,#DataAnalysis,#Programming,#Mathematics",advanced,4.0.3,TRUE

Advanced R - learn Development Tools
Best Development Tools Course
Become an R master and dominate data science
Build R packages,Write C++ code in R via Rcpp,Do complex date parsing,Profile and benchmark their programs,Build parallel code,Parse complex text via Regex,And much more!
A few weeks experience with R is absolutely necessary, and ideally some months of experience would be better,Being able to code functions, manipulate data, and be comfortable writing complex R code,Some experience with other programming languages (such as Python - Java) would be beneficial, but it is not necessary,This course is intended for R and data science professionals aiming to master R. Intermediate and advanced users, will both find that this course will¬†separate them¬†from the rest of people doing analytics with R. We don't recommend this course on beginners.,We start by explaining how to work with closures, environments, dates, and more advanced topics. We then move into regex expressions and parsing html data. We explain how to write R packages, and write the proper documentation that the CRAN team expects if you want to upload your code into R's libraries.¬†¬†After that we introduce the necessary skills for profiling your R code. We then move into C++ and Rcpp, and we show how to write super fast C++ parallel code that uses OpenMP. Understanding and mastering Rcpp will allow you to push your R skills to another dimension. When your colleagues are writing R functions, you will be able to get Rcpp+OpenMP equivalent code running 4-8X times faster. We then move into Python and Java, and show how these can be called from R and vice-versa. This will be really helpful for writing code that leverages the excellent object oriented features from this pair of languages. You will be able to build your own classes in Java or Python that store the data that you get from R. Since the Python community is growing so fast, and producing so wonderful packages, it's great to know that you will be able to call any function from any Python package directly from R. We finally explain how to use sqldf, which is a wonderful package for doing serious, production grade data processing in R. Even though it has its limitations, we will be able to write SQL queries directly in R. We will certainly show how to bypass those limitations, such as its inability to write full joins using specific tricks.,All the code (R,JAVA,C++,.csv) used in this course is available for download, and all the lectures can be downloaded as well. Our teaching strategy is to present you with examples carrying the minimal complexity, so we hope you can easily follow each lecture. In case you have doubts or comments, feel free to send us a message,,Intermediate and advanced R usersBasic R users (with a few weeks of experience) can also take this course.

__Zz3Nbi5RI,2020-10-18T00:00:00Z,UCxrpjLYi_Akmbc2QICDvKaQ,Introduction to Advanced Data Analysis in R programming language (First Lesson/Class),"Prior knowledge of programming and statistics are not required. It's only an introduction to the first class, and we will continue every Saturdays with more advanced tasks. The main goal is to develop the interest of mathematical programming among students from Africa. However, anyone who interested is welcome to join and learn. This class will be a good introduction to data analysis with advanced statistical software like R. 

For general information about the class, please visit the link below:

Below summarizes the content of this YouTube video (from Saturday's class dated October 17, 2020):

1) A brief introduction into mathematical programming, and the advantages of R to other programming languages (Python, SAS, etc.) and other statistical software like SPSS, STATA, etc.  are discussed. 

2)Expatiate on how R works, setting up working directories and importing data into R (Note that you can import a data saved as .csv, .txt, .xlsx, SPSS data, STATA data, SAS data, etc). Writing codes as a script, saving scripts and importing previously saved scripts for use another time. You be using R studio for everything; but after the first class, I will rather be using Jupyter notebook to run R whiles you use the R studio. The many importance of Jupyter notebook as an IDE to run R, Python and other programming languages will be explained in our second meeting.
3) How to use in-built functions, and create your own function(s) for any complicated task depending on what you want. 
4) We shall analyse our first real data where we will create our own novel function to compute summary statistics of the data (see the Resource section to download the CSV data named as School_data.csv). 
5) We will learn how to assign names to categorical variables coded with dummy numbers (eg. 0,1,2 etc). The novel summary statistics function we will be creating has never been created before. First, it must be automated such that for any data you use, it should be able to do the following. i) determine the type of any/all variable(s) in the data (whether categorical/qualitative or numerical/quantitative), ii) If a variable is numerical (like age, BMI, height,etc.), it should compute & return the mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, skewness and kurtosis; iii) else if a variable is categorical (like gender, marital status, etc.) it should return its percentages for all categories/levels of the variable rounded to exactly 1 decimal place. You will be given an assignment/task to add more complexity to this novel summary statistics function we shall create in class to be able to include descriptive plots as well.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__Zz3Nbi5RI/default.jpg,Clement Twumasi Educative Channel,1537,96,0,0,12,"#R,#Statistics,#DataAnalysis,#Programming,#Mathematics",advanced,4.0.3,TRUE
