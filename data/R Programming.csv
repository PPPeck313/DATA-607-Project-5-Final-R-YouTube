In this introduction to R course you will learn about the basics of R, as well as the most common data structures it uses to store data. By the end of this course, you will know how to create these data structures, manipulate them and perform calculations on them to get surprising insights.

But first things first: the basics of R. It's also called the language for statistical computing, and is one of the most popular languages to do data science, used by tons of companies and universities around the globe in all sorts of fields. Optimizing a financial portfolio? Mapping marketing data? Analyzing outcomes of clinical trials? You name it, R can handle it.

But why did R become so popular? Well, first of all, it's free to use! Next, R's visualization capabilities are top notch, making it easy to build beautiful plots. It's also easy to create so-called packages, which are extensions to R. R's very active community has created thousands of these packages for many different fields. Last but not least, R is an actual programming language, with a command-line interface for executing code. This is a big plus compared to other point-and-click programs out there. It might take some energy to fully get the hang of it, but feat not: DataCamp is here to help you master R in no time! Let's get started.

An important component of R, is the console. It's a place where you can execute R commands. In DataCamp's interactive interface, the console can be found here. Let's try to calculate the sum of 1 and 2. We simply type 1 + 2 at the prompt the console and hit Enter. R interprets what you typed and prints the result.

R is more than a scientific calculator, though. You can also create so-called variables. A variable allows you to store data in R for later use. You can use the less than sign followed by a dash to create a variable. Suppose the height of a rectangle is 2. Let's assign this value 2 to a variable height. In the console, we type height, less than sign, dash, 2:

This time, R does not print anything, because it assumes that you will be using this variable in the future. If you now simply type and execute height in the console, R returns 2:

We can do a similar thing for the width of our imaginary rectangle. We assign the value 4 to a variable width.

Typing width gives us 4, great.

As you're assigning variables in the R console, you're actually accumulating the R workspace. It's the place where R variables 'live'. You can list all variables with the ls() function. Simply type ls followed by empty parentheses and hit enter.

This shows you a list of all the variables you have created up to now. There are two objects in your workspace at the moment, height and width. I we try to access variable that's not in the workspace, depth for example, R throws an error.

Suppose you now want to find out the area of our imaginary rectangle, which is height multiplied by width. height equals 2, and width equals 4, so the result is 8. Let's also assign this result to a new variable, area.

Inspecting the workspace again with ls, shows that the workspace contains three objects now: area, height and width.

Now, this is all great, but what if you want to recalculate the area of your imaginary rectangle when the height is 3 and the width is 6? You'd have to reassign the variables width and height in the console, and then recalculate the area. That's quite some coding you'd have to redo, isn't it?

This is the place where R scripts come in! An R script is simply a text file with succesive lines of R code. Let's create such a script, ""rectangle.R"", that contains the code that we've written up to now.

Next, you can run this script. In the DataCamp interface, you can do this with the 'Submit Answer' button. R goes through your code, line by line, executing every command one by one in the console, just as if you are typing each command yourself. The cool thing is, that if you want to change your code, you can simply adapt your script and run it again. Let's change the height to 3 and the width to 6, and rerun the script. The variables are given different values this time, and the output changes accordingly.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SWxoJqTqo08/default.jpg,DataCamp,392240,2404,73,0,64,"R (Programming Language),data science"

You might wonder, what is R, and why you should learn R programming?
Well, R is a popular programming language adopted for data science and statistics, and The R programming language is used by professionals and data experts around the world for mapping marketing trends, modelling financial data, and so on.

And the best thing is, R programming language is free. R is an open-source statistical programming language supported by a community. R is also called the language for statistical computing. 

R runs on almost any computing platform and operating system. 
R provides a rich collection of statistical techniques or functions and has sophisticated graphical and visualization capabilities for plots and graphs. This language also provides a complex and sophisticated visualization of high-dimensional data. Another very important feature of R is that it is highly extensible. 

R language is not strictly in the sense only for statistics but also for advance mathematical modelling and machine learning.  This introduction to R course is the best way to start learning R programming and getting handy with its features. 

In this course, we will cover the R‚Äôs basics and programming fundamentals. Eventually, you will learn how to use R‚Äôs data structures such as Vectors, Matrices, Lists and Data frames. 

Each of these sections includes a screencast of hands-on implementation and is also accompanied by short quizzes. Finally, we will look at how to import data from various sources, and how to handle data large data. 

And on top of that in this course, we will move deeper into the graphical capabilities of R and learn how to create visualizations which will help in analysis.

In the end, we will perform basic statistical analysis on specifically designed stock price datasets to get the real feel of R‚Äôs statistical computing capabilities.

This video will try to walk through the concept of Object Oriented System in R as well as a guide on S3 and S4 objects. We will save S5 for some other time. 

S3 object is similar to the list system in R, while S4 object is much stricter and more resemblance to  OO systems. Despite not being common in a typical data analysis, OO is quite useful for communication of Experimental data for Bioinformatics Analysis to ensure the experiment package can be consistence from one platform to another.

We generate a sample of 1000 observations from a Gamma Distribution in order to carry out Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the parameters of the Gamma Distribution.

This code is then used to together with the uniroot function to solve for alpha (Œ±) hat. This is done because we need to determine where the partial derivative of the log-likelihood function is equal to 0. After we have found alpha (Œ±) hat , solving for lambda becomes a simple substitution and division problem.
