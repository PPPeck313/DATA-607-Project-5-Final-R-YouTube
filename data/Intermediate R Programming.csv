---

Hello and welcome to this course on programming with purrr.

I'm Colin Fay; I'm a data scientist and R hacker. As you can only hear me, here is a picture of me drinking coffee.

A big part of my day job is writing R code, and I use purrr to help me optimize my workflow.
Notably, I use purrr for writing functions, which is what you'll do in this course.

Before starting this course, make sure you've got some basic knowledge of iteration using purrr.
If you're not familiar with it, here are some great resources that can help you learn about iteration with purrr.

If you're already familiar iterating with purrr, you can start this course right now!

Almost every iteration process has two sides. The first are the elements we iterate over. The second is the function we apply to each element. purrr follows this format.

The first purrr function everyone learns is the map() function. map() has two elements. First, .x, which is the object we are iterating over ‚Äî this object can either be a vector, a list, or a data frame.

The second part includes .f and the dot dot dot argument, which represents the functional part of the iteration. It's the description of what happens to each element of the object.
In this course, you'll learn how to deal with the second half of the basic purrr skeleton: the .f and dot dot dot arguments.

For this course, I have extracted three lists from a dataset taken from the open data portal of the French city of St. Malo.

This dataset gathers a count of the number of visits on the website saint-malo.fr.

Each of these newly created lists is a year: 2014, 2015, and 2016. Each contains 12 sublists corresponding to months. Each month is a vector with the number of website visits per day.

These list objects are an extraction of the full dataset. This list format is one you regularly encounter when querying data on the web, notably when you have to deal with the JSON format, which is parsed as a nested list in R.

Let's start with a refresher of purrr basic functions using these three lists. 

First, let's see the map() function, that runs the .f function on each element of .x, and always returns a list. Here, we are mapping the sum() function on the list visit_2015.

One strength of purrr is that it is type stable, which means that you always know upfront the class of the output. Here, for example, we are using the map_dbl() function, which does the same operation as map(), but the output is different. As you can see, the result is a numeric vector rather than a list.


Let's now imagine we want to add visits from 2015 and 2016. To do this, I can use the map2() function to get a list, and its counterpart map2_dbl() to get a vector of numeric.

What if we want to do the same computation as the one previous slide, but with three lists? In purrr, there is no map3(), map4(), et cetera. If you want to map over more than two elements, you'll need to pass a list of elements to the pmap() function. 

To iterate over elements in three or more lists, you'll need to put all these lists into another list and pass this ""master list"" as the first argument of pmap().

Now it's your turn to refresh your purrr memory!

Hi, I am Ross Bennett. I am an analyst on a trading desk at a proprietary trading firm in Chicago. I am the co-author of PortfolioAnalytics and contribute to several other R packages used in finance. This course will build on the fundamental concepts from the Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in R course. We will explore more advanced concepts in the portfolio optimization process such as complex constraint and objective sets, methods for estimating moments, optimization with periodic rebalancing (also referred to as backtesting), and visualizations to better understand the optimization problem. The focus of the course is to use the PortfolioAnalytics package to solve portfolio optimization problems that mirror real-world applications.

Although Modern Portfolio Theory was introduced over 60 years ago, it establishes a framework for defining and evaluating objectives. In the Modern Portfolio Theory framework, the optimal portfolio for an investor to hold is the portfolio that maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk. The academic approach follows the Markowitz approach using mean return as a measure of gain and standard deviation of returns as a measure of risk. However, most real-world problems consider different measures of risk as well as multiple objectives and constraints. In this course, you will explore both the standard Markowitz approach and more complex problems similar to what you will encounter in industry.

Let's begin with an example to demonstrate how you can use PortfolioAnalytics to solve a portfolio problem using the Modern Portfolio Theory framework to maximize mean return and minimize standard deviation. You start with loading the PortfolioAnalytics library and a sample dataset. In the example in this video, you will use the first 8 columns of the edhec dataset. The edhec dataset contains monthly returns of the EDHEC composite hedge fund style index returns. You can create the portfolio specification object by initializing it with the column names of the dataset as the asset names. Now you add two constraints to the portfolio specification, full investment and long only constraints. The full investment constraint means that the weights must sum to 1. The long only constraint means that all weights must be positive. You have two objectives in the portfolio problem, one to maximize portfolio mean return and one to minimize portfolio standard deviation. For the mean return objective, the objective type is ""return"" because you want to maximize the objective. The objective name is ""mean"" for portfolio mean return. For the standard deviation risk objective, the objective type is ""risk"" because you want to minimize the objective. The objective name is ""StdDev"" for portfolio standard deviation. Don't worry if this is a lot to take in for now, you will see plenty of other examples in this course!

Now you can print the portfolio specification object to see a concise representation of the specification. You see the names of the assets in the portfolio, a list of the constraints and a list of the objectives. In this case, you can see the portfolio specification consists of 8 assets, 2 constraints (full investment and long only), and 2 objectives (mean and standard deviation).

In this slide, you can see how to run the optimization and visualize the results of the optimal portfolio. To run the optimization, call the function optimize.portfolio passing in the returns data, portfolio specification object, and optimization method. Note that you specify optimize_method = ""random"" to use the random portfolios algorithm to solve the problem. Also, note that you specify trace = TRUE. This stores the results of each iteration of the optimization. You can chart the optimal portfolio in terms of risk and reward with the chart.RiskReward function, passing in the optimization output, the objective names to use for risk and return, and TRUE or FALSE if you want to chart the assets. You can see this in the chart in the slide where the gray points are the objective values of a given iteration. Collectively, these portfolios form the feasible space, the set of portfolios that satisfy the specified constraints. Now, let's get started and have a look at some initial exercises.

#MachineLearningWithR #MachineLearningFullCourse #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearning #SimplilearnMachineLearning #MachineLearningCourse

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. 

R is a widely popular programming language in the field of machine learning. R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is the statistical model that is used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors. The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression is used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales analysis, etc.

OpenMx runs on Mac OS X, Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8), and several varieties of Linux. This means the same scripts you write in Windows will run in Mac OS X or Linux.

OpenMx is free and open source software for use with R that allows estimation of a wide variety of advanced multivariate statistical models. OpenMx consists of a library of functions and optimizers that allow you to quickly and flexibly define an SEM model and estimate parameters given observed data.

OpenMx can be used by those who think in terms of path models or by those who prefer to specify models in terms of matrix algebra. OpenMx is extremely powerful, taking full advantage of the R programming environment. This means that complicated models and data sets can be specified and modified using the R language.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vrHaAdjC97A/default.jpg,OpenMx TV,663,4,0,0,0,"hypothesis testing,statistics,path analysis,statistics (field of study),learning,linear regression,confirmatory factor analysis,latent variable path analysis,statistics 101,factor analysis,sem,OpenMx,tutorial,structural equation modeling,latent growth curve"

Anyway, I go into how to implement different kinds of functions and a bit of the different forms that functions can take. There is assignment form for simple functions and anonymous form for mapping-link functions. All these can be utilized in your code design and have their own pros and cons depending on what you need in your project.

OpenMx runs on Mac OS X, Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8), and several varieties of Linux. This means the same scripts you write in Windows will run in Mac OS X or Linux.

OpenMx is free and open source software for use with R that allows estimation of a wide variety of advanced multivariate statistical models. OpenMx consists of a library of functions and optimizers that allow you to quickly and flexibly define an SEM model and estimate parameters given observed data.

OpenMx can be used by those who think in terms of path models or by those who prefer to specify models in terms of matrix algebra. OpenMx is extremely powerful, taking full advantage of the R programming environment. This means that complicated models and data sets can be specified and modified using the R language.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QCQMBM8kKFc/default.jpg,OpenMx TV,171,2,0,0,0,"structural equation modeling,sem,statistics,statistics (field of study),research methods,structural equation modeling (sem),multivariate statistics,theory building,hypothesis development,lecture,r studio,r program,latent growth curve,LGC,Curve,OpenMx,factor analysis,CFA,EFA,growth,change,modeling growth,longetudinal"

OpenMx runs on Mac OS X, Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8), and several varieties of Linux. This means the same scripts you write in Windows will run in Mac OS X or Linux.

OpenMx is free and open source software for use with R that allows estimation of a wide variety of advanced multivariate statistical models. OpenMx consists of a library of functions and optimizers that allow you to quickly and flexibly define an SEM model and estimate parameters given observed data.

OpenMx can be used by those who think in terms of path models or by those who prefer to specify models in terms of matrix algebra. OpenMx is extremely powerful, taking full advantage of the R programming environment. This means that complicated models and data sets can be specified and modified using the R language.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S0fKPIX_4Ec/default.jpg,OpenMx TV,107,0,0,0,1,"structural equation modeling,sem,statistics,statistics (field of study),research methods,multivariate statistics,factor analysis,latent factor,latent variable,structural equation model,structural equation modeling (sem),path analysis,hypothesis development,theory building,lecture,identification,measurement,r studio,r program,introduction to structural equation modeling (sem),latent growth curve,LGC,LGC with curve,three factor lgc,longitudinal,OpenMx"
