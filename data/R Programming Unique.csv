4tWrfjNHXX8,2018-06-14T00:00:00Z,UC4f47QjRZYefjnhVACSOnKg,1. Statistics with R - Beginner Level (Introduction),"If you want to learn how to perform the basic statistical analyses in the R program, you have come to the right place.

Now you don’t have to scour the web endlessly in order to find how to compute the statistical indicators in R, how to build a cross-table, how to build a scatterplot chart or how to compute a simple statistical test like the one-sample t test. Everything is here, in this course, explained visually, step by step.

So, what will you learn in this course?

First of all, you will learn how to manipulate data in R, to prepare it for the analysis: how to filter your data frame, how to recode variables and compute new variables.

Afterwards, we will take care about computing the main statistical figures in R: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis etc., both in the whole population and in subgroups of the population.

Then you will learn how to visualize data using tables and charts. So we will build tables and cross-tables, as well as histograms, cumulative frequency charts, column and mean plot charts, scatterplot charts and boxplot charts.

Since assumption checking is a very important part of any statistical analysis, we could not elude this topic. So we’ll learn how to check for normality and for the presence of outliers.

Finally, we will perform some basic, one-sample statistical tests and interpret the results. I’m talking about the one-sample t test, the binomial test and the chi-square test for goodness-of-fit.

R Programming For Beginners:-
so why is it that our is becoming such a popular and useful tool in data analysis and statistical analysis I'm gonna tell you why stay tuned now the short answer
is this is one of the rare occasions when something that is free and open-source is in fact better and that this is in my opinion better then the expensive commercially available
alternatives that are out there and if you don't believe me just look at the trends there are masses of people moving from SPSS to are from Stata to are from SS to R I don't see anybody moving the other direction now R is essentially a programming 
language and you might find that fact a little bit intimidating or scary but don't and you'll see when I do the little demonstration at the end of the video that it's not difficult to use that it's relatively intuitive and you can learn
it and there's loads and loads of support out there if you need it the importance of using code to it when you do data analysis is that your your your analysis is reproducible somebody else
can see exactly how it is that you got to the answers that you got to added to that you've got the ability to collaborate with other people and they
can look at what you've done and make suggestions or changes or identify mistakes in your analysis and you can't do that with a point-and-click system and the next reason why using code to do
your analysis is important is that not only is your analysis reproducible but it's also repeatable in other words if a year from now you've got additional data
let's say you had data for 2018 and 2019 you've got double the data set you want to rerun that analysis you just run your your code and everything your your data
cleaning your data manipulation and your analysis all gets repeated right there and then at the push of a button now one of the most exciting things about R is
because it's open source you've got people all over the world writing packages and packages and things that you can install and use that deal with very specific data analytic
problems and these are free and there are literally thousands of them another big advantage of using R is that it has incredible data visualization and graphics capabilities in fact in that sense it beats any other package hands down it's a slam dunk nothing  comes close right now I'm going to do a short demonstration just to show you that using a program language to do analysis is not difficult it's not scary it's relatively simple okay so watch this so in this particular example I have got a little data frame called friends I click on that and we can see it over here we've got some variables and some observations I'm looking at age and height let's see what we can do with those basically the way the coding works is you apply a function to an object so in this case the function might be the mean we want to know the mean of age which is the object which is 23 we might want to know the median of the height we can plot a histogram of the age or plot age against height and we might want to know if there is a statistically significant correlation between age and height and as we can see in this particular case there isn't right so clearly writing code is not that scary at all I mean I haven't broken up into a sweat you'll notice that I don't have a tremor I don't have a heart palpitation I haven't fallen over dead I've actually survived it's not difficult it's not scary you can do it now if you're interested in learning art and why don't you subscribe to this channel follow the videos I'm going to start off by just talking you through how to install our how to install rstudio which is where you're going to write the code and then we're going to go through everything data analysis data manipulation erotic visualization all the way up to machine learning and AI thanks for watching leave your comments and questions in the discussion section below

What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is the statistical model that is used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors. The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression is used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales analysis, etc.

'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models on text data 
""This is apt for everyone”

---------------------------------


Why Learn Natural Language Processing or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

Introduction to Apache Spark:
Apache Spark Is an open-source cluster computing framework that was initially developed at UC Berkeley in the AMPLab. As compared to the disk-based, two-stage MapReduce of Hadoop, Spark provides up to 100 times faster performance for a few applications with in-memory primitives. This makes it suitable for machine learning algorithms, as it allows programs to load data into the memory of a cluster and query the data constantly. A Spark project contains various components such as Spark Core and Resilient Distributed Datasets or RDDs, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, Machine Learning Library or Mllib, and GraphX.

Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

Beginner workouts are incredibly important since they set the foundation for all gains to come.  In this video, I’m going to go over the biggest beginner workout mistakes that people make that undercut their ability to see the best results that they can get in the long run.  I will cover everything from the importance of the bench press, squat and deadlift while remembering not to rely solely on them or attempt to lift too much weight at the expense of good form.

To start, full range of motion on exercises is incredibly important for anyone lifting weights.  This holds true whether you are a beginner or even more advanced.  The use of full range of motion helps to strengthen the kinetic chain while improving coordination.  Many beginners lack joint coordination or awareness in space and instead will use shortened range of motions in order to trick themselves into thinking they are doing more than they are.

The compound lifts are key exercises for promoting the opportunity for full range of motion.  Because they utilize multiple muscle groups and joints they allow you to load up the highest amounts of weights that you can on any exercise.  That tends to create some fear of these exercises for beginners however.  The sense of danger on these exercises is certainly higher than on a concentration curl but that doesn’t mean they should be avoided.

Instead, using weight that you can command and building a true strength base on top of that is the answer.  If you start using weights that you can handle and continue to increase your strength on these lifts over time, you won’t fear the movement.  As you see results come from performing these exercises you will become less self conscious of those around you and your fears of using weights that you feel are too light in comparison to what others are using.

Remember, we all start somewhere.  Even the strongest guy in the gym started out using the bar.  Keep adding weights only when you can perform the lift in good form.  Too many so called experts think that it is a badge of honor to have a “strong” lift when it is nothing more than an average lift wrapped around a whole lot of bad form and compensation.  Do not copy this.  You may even wind up looking as bad as they do if you follow that advice.

From here you want to make sure that you do not approach your training and workout sessions lazily.  What this means is that instead of just grabbing a bar, squeeze it for all its worth.  The strength that is elicited by simply doing that will surprise you.  Do not just move the bar from point A to point B, execute the movement and exercise with your highest intensity.  You will need a great deal of grip strength as a beginner to take advantage of this but you can build that by not avoiding forearm work and remembering to rack all of your own dumbbells and plates.

If you are looking for a workout program for beginners that will help you to build muscle fast, head to http://athleanx.com and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.  Start training like an athlete and building a solid foundation of muscle, strength and athleticism and you will be amazed at how much faster you see results long term.

More than a video, you'll learn hands-on coding & quickly apply skills to your daily work.

---

Hello and welcome to this course on programming with purrr.

I'm Colin Fay; I'm a data scientist and R hacker. As you can only hear me, here is a picture of me drinking coffee.

A big part of my day job is writing R code, and I use purrr to help me optimize my workflow.
Notably, I use purrr for writing functions, which is what you'll do in this course.

Before starting this course, make sure you've got some basic knowledge of iteration using purrr.
If you're not familiar with it, here are some great resources that can help you learn about iteration with purrr.

If you're already familiar iterating with purrr, you can start this course right now!

Almost every iteration process has two sides. The first are the elements we iterate over. The second is the function we apply to each element. purrr follows this format.

The first purrr function everyone learns is the map() function. map() has two elements. First, .x, which is the object we are iterating over — this object can either be a vector, a list, or a data frame.

The second part includes .f and the dot dot dot argument, which represents the functional part of the iteration. It's the description of what happens to each element of the object.
In this course, you'll learn how to deal with the second half of the basic purrr skeleton: the .f and dot dot dot arguments.

For this course, I have extracted three lists from a dataset taken from the open data portal of the French city of St. Malo.

This dataset gathers a count of the number of visits on the website saint-malo.fr.

Each of these newly created lists is a year: 2014, 2015, and 2016. Each contains 12 sublists corresponding to months. Each month is a vector with the number of website visits per day.

These list objects are an extraction of the full dataset. This list format is one you regularly encounter when querying data on the web, notably when you have to deal with the JSON format, which is parsed as a nested list in R.

Let's start with a refresher of purrr basic functions using these three lists. 

First, let's see the map() function, that runs the .f function on each element of .x, and always returns a list. Here, we are mapping the sum() function on the list visit_2015.

One strength of purrr is that it is type stable, which means that you always know upfront the class of the output. Here, for example, we are using the map_dbl() function, which does the same operation as map(), but the output is different. As you can see, the result is a numeric vector rather than a list.


Let's now imagine we want to add visits from 2015 and 2016. To do this, I can use the map2() function to get a list, and its counterpart map2_dbl() to get a vector of numeric.

What if we want to do the same computation as the one previous slide, but with three lists? In purrr, there is no map3(), map4(), et cetera. If you want to map over more than two elements, you'll need to pass a list of elements to the pmap() function. 

To iterate over elements in three or more lists, you'll need to put all these lists into another list and pass this ""master list"" as the first argument of pmap().

Now it's your turn to refresh your purrr memory!

Hi, I am Ross Bennett. I am an analyst on a trading desk at a proprietary trading firm in Chicago. I am the co-author of PortfolioAnalytics and contribute to several other R packages used in finance. This course will build on the fundamental concepts from the Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in R course. We will explore more advanced concepts in the portfolio optimization process such as complex constraint and objective sets, methods for estimating moments, optimization with periodic rebalancing (also referred to as backtesting), and visualizations to better understand the optimization problem. The focus of the course is to use the PortfolioAnalytics package to solve portfolio optimization problems that mirror real-world applications.

Although Modern Portfolio Theory was introduced over 60 years ago, it establishes a framework for defining and evaluating objectives. In the Modern Portfolio Theory framework, the optimal portfolio for an investor to hold is the portfolio that maximizes portfolio expected return for a given level of risk. The academic approach follows the Markowitz approach using mean return as a measure of gain and standard deviation of returns as a measure of risk. However, most real-world problems consider different measures of risk as well as multiple objectives and constraints. In this course, you will explore both the standard Markowitz approach and more complex problems similar to what you will encounter in industry.

Let's begin with an example to demonstrate how you can use PortfolioAnalytics to solve a portfolio problem using the Modern Portfolio Theory framework to maximize mean return and minimize standard deviation. You start with loading the PortfolioAnalytics library and a sample dataset. In the example in this video, you will use the first 8 columns of the edhec dataset. The edhec dataset contains monthly returns of the EDHEC composite hedge fund style index returns. You can create the portfolio specification object by initializing it with the column names of the dataset as the asset names. Now you add two constraints to the portfolio specification, full investment and long only constraints. The full investment constraint means that the weights must sum to 1. The long only constraint means that all weights must be positive. You have two objectives in the portfolio problem, one to maximize portfolio mean return and one to minimize portfolio standard deviation. For the mean return objective, the objective type is ""return"" because you want to maximize the objective. The objective name is ""mean"" for portfolio mean return. For the standard deviation risk objective, the objective type is ""risk"" because you want to minimize the objective. The objective name is ""StdDev"" for portfolio standard deviation. Don't worry if this is a lot to take in for now, you will see plenty of other examples in this course!

Now you can print the portfolio specification object to see a concise representation of the specification. You see the names of the assets in the portfolio, a list of the constraints and a list of the objectives. In this case, you can see the portfolio specification consists of 8 assets, 2 constraints (full investment and long only), and 2 objectives (mean and standard deviation).

In this slide, you can see how to run the optimization and visualize the results of the optimal portfolio. To run the optimization, call the function optimize.portfolio passing in the returns data, portfolio specification object, and optimization method. Note that you specify optimize_method = ""random"" to use the random portfolios algorithm to solve the problem. Also, note that you specify trace = TRUE. This stores the results of each iteration of the optimization. You can chart the optimal portfolio in terms of risk and reward with the chart.RiskReward function, passing in the optimization output, the objective names to use for risk and return, and TRUE or FALSE if you want to chart the assets. You can see this in the chart in the slide where the gray points are the objective values of a given iteration. Collectively, these portfolios form the feasible space, the set of portfolios that satisfy the specified constraints. Now, let's get started and have a look at some initial exercises.

#MachineLearningWithR #MachineLearningFullCourse #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearning #SimplilearnMachineLearning #MachineLearningCourse

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. 

R is a widely popular programming language in the field of machine learning. R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

[WIP]

ADDITIONAL STUFF YOU CAN DO (don’t feel overwhelmed, there is no wrong path)

- Learn functional programming. Languages like Scheme. It’s a completely different style of coding. Disclaimer: it might not have much application use to you right now, but will open up your mind to a new perspective.
- Develop an Alexa Skill. They’re becoming quite popular.
- Learn something new on Udacity that is more specific than just a programming language (artificial intelligence, REACT Developer, Python automation, natural language processing, virtual reality)

PRACTICE & PREMADE RESOURCES
There’s an endless amount of practice resources on the internet, you’ll just have to dig through to see what you like best.

- Data Structures & Algorithms in Python https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513

APIs
APIs allow you to plug into some of your favorite websites and applications and grab data from it to use in your own programs. I’ll link a few popular APIs below.
- How to Use APIs: A Painless Introduction + Tutorials https://snipcart.com/blog/apis-integration-usage-benefits
- Spotify Web API (since mentioned in the video) https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
- OpenWeatherMap API (to pull weather data from) https://www.openweathermap.org/api

OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
This is a pretty abstract idea, that multiple languages are based off (Java, Python, Ruby, C++, and more). It turns out that many beginner courses don’t actually take advantage building objects in object-oriented languages. Instead, they first teach you variables, loops, if-statements, etc… so it make sense. Now is the best time to practice 🙂

What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is the statistical model that is used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors. The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression is used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales analysis, etc.

Anyway, I go into how to implement different kinds of functions and a bit of the different forms that functions can take. There is assignment form for simple functions and anonymous form for mapping-link functions. All these can be utilized in your code design and have their own pros and cons depending on what you need in your project.

OpenMx runs on Mac OS X, Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8), and several varieties of Linux. This means the same scripts you write in Windows will run in Mac OS X or Linux.

OpenMx is free and open source software for use with R that allows estimation of a wide variety of advanced multivariate statistical models. OpenMx consists of a library of functions and optimizers that allow you to quickly and flexibly define an SEM model and estimate parameters given observed data.

OpenMx can be used by those who think in terms of path models or by those who prefer to specify models in terms of matrix algebra.

Speaker: Hadley Wickham
Date: 6/20/2019

Abstract

Functional programming (FP) provides a rich set of tools for reducing duplication in your code. The goal of FP is to make it easy to express repeated actions using high-level verbs. I think that learning a little about FP is really important for data scientists, because it's a really good fit for many problems that you'll encounter in practice.

In this talk, I'll introduce you to the basics of functional programming in R, using the purrr package. I'll begin by briefly dissecting the for loop that you're already familiar with, then continue to show why functional programming provides elegant alternatives. I'll next dive into two examples showing where FP is particularly useful in data science: when ingesting unruly datasets spread across multiple files, and producing multiple reports for different stakeholders.

You'll get the most out of this talk if you're familiar with R, or you've done data science in other languages like Python.

This is a two-day hands-on workshop based on the book ""R Markdown: The Definitive Guide"". 

This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level. We'll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.

You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of the amazing breadth and depth of R Markdown. You'll get the most from it if you enjoy learning how R Markdown works under the hood (which will involve reading some source code), and are seriously interested in hacking (playing) with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, LaTeX, and command-line tools. We will give minimal tutorials on these languages and tools in the workshop, but it may be easier for you to keep pace with the instructor if you already know them before.

This workshop is led by Yihui Xie, Software Engineer and Data Scientist at RStudio. Yihui is the main author of the open-source knitr package for reproducible research and dynamic report generation. He has also created and co-authored several other R packages, including rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, xaringan, tinytex, DT, shiny, and leaflet. He has authored and co-authored four books: Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown, blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown, and R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.

Advanced R Programming training day
21st – 24th February
London Olympia
sqlbits.com

If you’re relatively comfortable with R but find yourself needing to level up your skills this day is for you. Whether you’re hitting in-memory constraints, needing the latest and greatest machine learning algorithm, having to code defensively, or simply needing to get more stuff done, you’ll get a lot out of this day of training. This hands-on day will equip you with more tools for performing data engineering and data science in R.

We’ll be covering the following:
– Fast and efficient data processing in R with data.table for improved native R performance
– Working with active external connections in dplyr to push data manipulation to databases
– Leveraging functional programming for working with lists, unstructured data objects, and improving error handling
– Going beyond base R statistics with native-R solutions (caret and the tidyverse) and connected solutions (h2o and spark) for better interfaces, new techniques, and working at scale
– Incorporating Python, JavaScript, and C++ into your R code to extend R or leverage already coded solutions easily

-Dm5IEw0DUk,2020-11-01T00:00:00Z,UCxrpjLYi_Akmbc2QICDvKaQ,Introduction to Advanced Data Analysis in R programming language (Third Lesson/Class),"Prior knowledge of programming and statistics are not required. It's only an introduction to Advanced Data Analysis, and we will continue every Saturdays with more advanced tasks. The main goal is to develop the interest of mathematical programming among students from Africa. However, anyone who interested is welcome to join and learn. This class will be a good introduction to data analysis with advanced statistical software like R.

Below summarizes the content of this YouTube video- third lesson:

DISCLAIMER: This is a continuation of the previous YouTube videos, so watch them before this video. That will help us wrap up all we have done in our previous meetings so far before we start the Inferential Statistical Analyses (ie. statistical tests and models) from next week. The script (and a Jupyter HTML file) for this video has been uploaded on Piazza platform for you to practice at your own pace with it afterwards.

The primary goal of this third meeting/youtube video is to solve some assignment tasks to wrap up what has been learnt so far. Below are the assignment tasks (from Saturday's class dated October 31, 2020):

1. Assign the names to the levels of the categorical variables (Residence) where 1 means South; 2 means North; 3 means East; 4 means West.

2. Create a new numerical variable called Total_points; which is obtained after adding both the Enrolment_Points and Mathematics points for each student & add this new variable (Total_points) to the original data.

3. Convert their Mathematics points to a categorical variable called Mathematics_grade with categories: i) Low class if Mathematics point is less 40% ii) Medium class if Mathematics point is from 40% to 70%  and iii) High class if Mathematics point greater than 70%.

4. Save the new data as a  CSV file directly into your working directory/DataAnalysis_results_R folder.

5. Create your own function to compute descriptive/summary statistics (just update what I created already in the second meeting dated October 24, 2020). The summary statistics function should:  i) First determine the type of variable, ii). If it's numeric find & return mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, standard error, skewness, kurtosis and 95% quantile recorded to 2 decimal places as well as histogram plot of the numeric variable coloured by “green” colour. iii) Else if it is categorical, it should find & return percentages for all categories/levels (in 1 decimal place) and the name of the categories as a data frame as well as plot a pie chart with percentages for each category of the variable with different colours.

6. For each variable, find the summary statistics with the data created above.

7. Depict at least 8 figures/plots (it can be more than 8) using only ggplot2 package to describe the data the best you can as a Data scientist (example of the plots are line graphs, scatter plots, barplot, boxplot, histograms of numeric variables across different categories, barchart of categorical variables distinguishing between different categories variables, etc ). Figures should be nice and very informative too as a professional Data Scientist.

8. Produce 5 different plots to also summarize the data the best you can without the use of the ggplot2 package.


9. Find the correlation matrix plots between all the numerical variables (Enrolment_points, Mathematics points and Total points) using the ""PerformanceAnalytics"" R package.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Dm5IEw0DUk/default.jpg,Clement Twumasi Educative Channel,306,15,0,0,4,"#R,#Statistics,#DataAnalysis,#Programming,#Mathematics",advanced,4.0.3,TRUE

Advanced R - learn Development Tools
Best Development Tools Course
Become an R master and dominate data science
Build R packages,Write C++ code in R via Rcpp,Do complex date parsing,Profile and benchmark their programs,Build parallel code,Parse complex text via Regex,And much more!
A few weeks experience with R is absolutely necessary, and ideally some months of experience would be better,Being able to code functions, manipulate data, and be comfortable writing complex R code,Some experience with other programming languages (such as Python - Java) would be beneficial, but it is not necessary,This course is intended for R and data science professionals aiming to master R. Intermediate and advanced users, will both find that this course will separate them from the rest of people doing analytics with R. We don't recommend this course on beginners.,We start by explaining how to work with closures, environments, dates, and more advanced topics. We then move into regex expressions and parsing html data. We explain how to write R packages, and write the proper documentation that the CRAN team expects if you want to upload your code into R's libraries.  After that we introduce the necessary skills for profiling your R code. We then move into C++ and Rcpp, and we show how to write super fast C++ parallel code that uses OpenMP. Understanding and mastering Rcpp will allow you to push your R skills to another dimension. When your colleagues are writing R functions, you will be able to get Rcpp+OpenMP equivalent code running 4-8X times faster. We then move into Python and Java, and show how these can be called from R and vice-versa. This will be really helpful for writing code that leverages the excellent object oriented features from this pair of languages. You will be able to build your own classes in Java or Python that store the data that you get from R. Since the Python community is growing so fast, and producing so wonderful packages, it's great to know that you will be able to call any function from any Python package directly from R. We finally explain how to use sqldf, which is a wonderful package for doing serious, production grade data processing in R. Even though it has its limitations, we will be able to write SQL queries directly in R. We will certainly show how to bypass those limitations, such as its inability to write full joins using specific tricks.,All the code (R,JAVA,C++,.csv) used in this course is available for download, and all the lectures can be downloaded as well. Our teaching strategy is to present you with examples carrying the minimal complexity, so we hope you can easily follow each lecture. In case you have doubts or comments, feel free to send us a message,,Intermediate and advanced R usersBasic R users (with a few weeks of experience) can also take this course.

__Zz3Nbi5RI,2020-10-18T00:00:00Z,UCxrpjLYi_Akmbc2QICDvKaQ,Introduction to Advanced Data Analysis in R programming language (First Lesson/Class),"Prior knowledge of programming and statistics are not required. It's only an introduction to the first class, and we will continue every Saturdays with more advanced tasks. The main goal is to develop the interest of mathematical programming among students from Africa. However, anyone who interested is welcome to join and learn. This class will be a good introduction to data analysis with advanced statistical software like R. 

For general information about the class, please visit the link below:

Below summarizes the content of this YouTube video (from Saturday's class dated October 17, 2020):

1) A brief introduction into mathematical programming, and the advantages of R to other programming languages (Python, SAS, etc.) and other statistical software like SPSS, STATA, etc.  are discussed. 

2)Expatiate on how R works, setting up working directories and importing data into R (Note that you can import a data saved as .csv, .txt, .xlsx, SPSS data, STATA data, SAS data, etc). Writing codes as a script, saving scripts and importing previously saved scripts for use another time. You be using R studio for everything; but after the first class, I will rather be using Jupyter notebook to run R whiles you use the R studio. The many importance of Jupyter notebook as an IDE to run R, Python and other programming languages will be explained in our second meeting.
3) How to use in-built functions, and create your own function(s) for any complicated task depending on what you want. 
4) We shall analyse our first real data where we will create our own novel function to compute summary statistics of the data (see the Resource section to download the CSV data named as School_data.csv). 
5) We will learn how to assign names to categorical variables coded with dummy numbers (eg. 0,1,2 etc). The novel summary statistics function we will be creating has never been created before. First, it must be automated such that for any data you use, it should be able to do the following. i) determine the type of any/all variable(s) in the data (whether categorical/qualitative or numerical/quantitative), ii) If a variable is numerical (like age, BMI, height,etc.), it should compute & return the mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, skewness and kurtosis; iii) else if a variable is categorical (like gender, marital status, etc.) it should return its percentages for all categories/levels of the variable rounded to exactly 1 decimal place. You will be given an assignment/task to add more complexity to this novel summary statistics function we shall create in class to be able to include descriptive plots as well.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/__Zz3Nbi5RI/default.jpg,Clement Twumasi Educative Channel,1537,96,0,0,12,"#R,#Statistics,#DataAnalysis,#Programming,#Mathematics",advanced,4.0.3,TRUE
