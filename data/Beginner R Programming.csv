4tWrfjNHXX8,2018-06-14T00:00:00Z,UC4f47QjRZYefjnhVACSOnKg,1. Statistics with R - Beginner Level (Introduction),"If you want to learn how to perform the basic statistical analyses in the R program, you have come to the right place.

Now you don‚Äôt have to scour the web endlessly in order to find how to compute the statistical indicators in R, how to build a cross-table, how to build a scatterplot chart or how to compute a simple statistical test like the one-sample t test. Everything is here, in this course, explained visually, step by step.

So, what will you learn in this course?

First of all, you will learn how to manipulate data in R, to prepare it for the analysis: how to filter your data frame, how to recode variables and compute new variables.

Afterwards, we will take care about computing the main statistical figures in R: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis etc., both in the whole population and in subgroups of the population.

Then you will learn how to visualize data using tables and charts. So we will build tables and cross-tables, as well as histograms, cumulative frequency charts, column and mean plot charts, scatterplot charts and boxplot charts.

Since assumption checking is a very important part of any statistical analysis, we could not elude this topic. So we‚Äôll learn how to check for normality and for the presence of outliers.

Finally, we will perform some basic, one-sample statistical tests and interpret the results. I‚Äôm talking about the one-sample t test, the binomial test and the chi-square test for goodness-of-fit.

R Programming For Beginners:-
so why is it that our is becoming such a popular and useful tool in data analysis and statistical analysis I'm gonna tell you why stay tuned now the short answer
is this is one of the rare occasions when something that is free and open-source is in fact better and that this is in my opinion better then the expensive commercially available
alternatives that are out there and if you don't believe me just look at the trends there are masses of people moving from SPSS to are from Stata to are from SS to R I don't see anybody moving the other direction now R is essentially a programming 
language and you might find that fact a little bit intimidating or scary but don't and you'll see when I do the little demonstration at the end of the video that it's not difficult to use that it's relatively intuitive and you can learn
it and there's loads and loads of support out there if you need it the importance of using code to it when you do data analysis is that your your your analysis is reproducible somebody else
can see exactly how it is that you got to the answers that you got to added to that you've got the ability to collaborate with other people and they
can look at what you've done and make suggestions or changes or identify mistakes in your analysis and you can't do that with a point-and-click system and the next reason why using code to do
your analysis is important is that not only is your analysis reproducible but it's also repeatable in other words if a year from now you've got additional data
let's say you had data for 2018 and 2019 you've got double the data set you want to rerun that analysis you just run your your code and everything your your data
cleaning your data manipulation and your analysis all gets repeated right there and then at the push of a button now one of the most exciting things about R is
because it's open source you've got people all over the world writing packages and packages and things that you can install and use that deal with very specific data analytic
problems and these are free and there are literally thousands of them another big advantage of using R is that it has incredible data visualization and graphics capabilities in fact in that sense it beats any other package hands down it's a slam dunk nothing  comes close right now I'm going to do a short demonstration just to show you that using a program language to do analysis is not difficult it's not scary it's relatively simple okay so watch this so in this particular example I have got a little data frame called friends I click on that and we can see it over here we've got some variables and some observations I'm looking at age and height let's see what we can do with those basically the way the coding works is you apply a function to an object so in this case the function might be the mean we want to know the mean of age which is the object which is 23 we might want to know the median of the height we can plot a histogram of the age or plot age against height and we might want to know if there is a statistically significant correlation between age and height and as we can see in this particular case there isn't right so clearly writing code is not that scary at all I mean I haven't broken up into a sweat you'll notice that I don't have a tremor I don't have a heart palpitation I haven't fallen over dead I've actually survived it's not difficult it's not scary you can do it now if you're interested in learning art and why don't you subscribe to this channel follow the videos I'm going to start off by just talking you through how to install our how to install rstudio which is where you're going to write the code and then we're going to go through everything data analysis data manipulation erotic visualization all the way up to machine learning and AI thanks for watching leave your comments and questions in the discussion section below

What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression is the statistical model that is used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors. The first one is which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable and the second one is how significant is the regression line to make predictions with the highest possible accuracy. Linear regression is used in stock price prediction, weather forecasting, sales analysis, etc.

'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models on text data 
""This is apt for everyone‚Äù

---------------------------------


Why Learn Natural Language Processing or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

Introduction to Apache Spark:
Apache Spark Is an open-source cluster computing framework that was initially developed at UC Berkeley in the AMPLab. As compared to the disk-based, two-stage MapReduce of Hadoop, Spark provides up to 100 times faster performance for a few applications with in-memory primitives. This makes it suitable for machine learning algorithms, as it allows programs to load data into the memory of a cluster and query the data constantly. A Spark project contains various components such as Spark Core and Resilient Distributed Datasets or RDDs, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, Machine Learning Library or Mllib, and GraphX.

Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

Beginner workouts are incredibly important since they set the foundation for all gains to come.  In this video, I‚Äôm going to go over the biggest beginner workout mistakes that people make that undercut their ability to see the best results that they can get in the long run.  I will cover everything from the importance of the bench press, squat and deadlift while remembering not to rely solely on them or attempt to lift too much weight at the expense of good form.

To start, full range of motion on exercises is incredibly important for anyone lifting weights.  This holds true whether you are a beginner or even more advanced.  The use of full range of motion helps to strengthen the kinetic chain while improving coordination.  Many beginners lack joint coordination or awareness in space and instead will use shortened range of motions in order to trick themselves into thinking they are doing more than they are.

The compound lifts are key exercises for promoting the opportunity for full range of motion.  Because they utilize multiple muscle groups and joints they allow you to load up the highest amounts of weights that you can on any exercise.  That tends to create some fear of these exercises for beginners however.  The sense of danger on these exercises is certainly higher than on a concentration curl but that doesn‚Äôt mean they should be avoided.

Instead, using weight that you can command and building a true strength base on top of that is the answer.  If you start using weights that you can handle and continue to increase your strength on these lifts over time, you won‚Äôt fear the movement.  As you see results come from performing these exercises you will become less self conscious of those around you and your fears of using weights that you feel are too light in comparison to what others are using.

Remember, we all start somewhere.  Even the strongest guy in the gym started out using the bar.  Keep adding weights only when you can perform the lift in good form.  Too many so called experts think that it is a badge of honor to have a ‚Äústrong‚Äù lift when it is nothing more than an average lift wrapped around a whole lot of bad form and compensation.  Do not copy this.  You may even wind up looking as bad as they do if you follow that advice.

From here you want to make sure that you do not approach your training and workout sessions lazily.  What this means is that instead of just grabbing a bar, squeeze it for all its worth.  The strength that is elicited by simply doing that will surprise you.  Do not just move the bar from point A to point B, execute the movement and exercise with your highest intensity.  You will need a great deal of grip strength as a beginner to take advantage of this but you can build that by not avoiding forearm work and remembering to rack all of your own dumbbells and plates.

If you are looking for a workout program for beginners that will help you to build muscle fast, head to http://athleanx.com and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.  Start training like an athlete and building a solid foundation of muscle, strength and athleticism and you will be amazed at how much faster you see results long term.
